title: 'How Do I Start Working with YaaS?'
---

<p>By now, you have already seen some of the main YaaS building blocks, for example the&nbsp;<a href="https://market.yaas.io/standard">YaaS Market</a>.</p>
<p>YaaS Market is an online marketplace where you subscribe to packages.</p>
<p>You have also seen the&nbsp;<a href="https://builder.yaas.io/login/login.html">Builder</a>. &nbsp;The Builder is an orchestration and publishing component. It's where you manage your organization, projects, packages, and perform different daily tasks such as managing loyalty programs. So, what else is there?</p>
<p>There is the Dev Portal, an information and knowledge hub for developers. In the Dev Portal, developers can read documentation and access free online trainings to learn about YaaS and available services. Additionally, all necessary technical information about microservices and packages is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://devportal.yaas.io/">Dev Portal</a>.</p>
<p>There is also the <a href="https://knowledge.yaas.io/">Knowledge Hub</a>, the information and learning hub for non-technical people. It contains various guides, articles, and free online training.</p>
<p>If you want to receive updates on new package releases, the YaaS teams publish release notes for each new version of every package. You can find the list <a href="https://devportal.yaas.io/rn/">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you need help, there's<a href="https://experts.hybris.com/spaces/151/index.html">Hybris Experts</a>. You can simply submit your question and one or more of our experts, or maybe even your peers will answer. Hybris Experts is part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://community.yaas.io/">YaaS Community</a>. Both are open to everyone. You can read questions and answers on Hybris Experts without registration, but to write a question, you will have to register.</p>
